The following text is copied from the Dutch ZIB model Mobility-v3.2:

Mobility describes the abilities and any limitations in all aspects of mobility, such as changing position, walking and moving forward, in some cases with the help of an aid.

The abilities and any limitations to mobility are documented:
- to be able to take this into account when in contact with the patient and when providing care to the patient;
- so as to monitor mobility in the event that mobility limitations are the subject of treatment;
- to be able to warrant the continuity of care in transfers.

The definitions of the concepts were (partially) taken from the ICF and ICNP definitions.">
